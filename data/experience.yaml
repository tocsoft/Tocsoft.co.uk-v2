- role: Senior Developer
  company: 2020 Legal Limited
  range: December 2013 - April 2017
  summary: |
        During my time employed at 2020 Legal I had been directly responsible for improving development practices
        and producing high impact systems.
        
        In my role I had complete autonomy about technical architecture of the systems and been instrumental 
        in the technical direction of the development team, this includes introducing best practice development 
        procedures, moving the company over from using SVN over to git and introducing the gitflow development 
        pattern, worked to improve the continuous build/deployment workflowm by moving deployment over to octopus
        deploy to provide a central deployment solution across our projects, and also move company over to a SOA 
        for internal systems and implementing a middleware service wrapping the data provided by the CRM used to 
        provide a clean API 2 directional to integrate new tools. Also as a proof of concept of the API I migrated 
        the existing customer portals over to run from it exclusively.
        
        I produced a multitude of technical systems for 2020 Legal from small single integration pieces (producing 
        a system to work around the technical limitations of the CRM being used). To large scale(effecting every single 
        employee in the company) systems for managing outgoing mail/printing/documents (see EDS and PEX).
        
        In addition to the above projects, as a full stack developer, I have reprised my skills from my previous employment 
        to rebuild most of the company's websites using Umbraco.

- role: Developer
  company: ICE Creates Ltd
  range: March 2007 - November 2013
  summary: |
        Over the long period of time I have been employed at ICE I have progressed from being a junior developer all the way 
        up to the mid-level/senior developer was when I left am today. In my role I am acting as the technical lead/architect 
        on all software being produced (Being the point of decision for both back-end and front-end development choices) not 
        only am I responsible for leading the technical direction of the team I am also a full stack developer and fully deliver 
        full solutions myself, developing both front end and back end solutions for internal and external clients alike.
        
        During my time at ICE I've been involved with a large variety of different projects. My first project(Healthy Schools 
        Programme website) was re-factoring a hybrid VB.NET/C#, single layered, WebForms solution into an n-tier C# application 
        (and later re-developing it as an multi-application MVC system), all whilst constantly improving/expanding the feature set. 
        Later on as my skills expanded and I progressed up the job ladder I was given more and more responsibility over the full 
        development life-cycle of projects, from scope all the way to development and deployment. Two internal projects that I did 
        have full responsibility of delivery for was a bespoke CRM for our in house stop smoking service, and our SaaS hosting service. 
        The CRM was a WinForms application using a local CouchDB as a offline multi-master replicating datastore with a customised 
        reporting solution build on top of couchDB's map/reduce capabilities, whilst the SaaS solution was built around a core MVC and 
        WebAPI solutions, with satellite Umbraco based sites liking in as a data/user/settings store.
        
        In addition to the above projects, as a full stack developer, I have been responsible for producing countless websites for 
        clients, developing the solution, to implementing the designs and then wiring up the JavaScript to back-end web-services 
        I developed. The types of websites I have been responsible for over the years have varied in scope from simple brochure 
        sites to complex web application used for tracking physical activity.

        Finally I have a wider experiences than just developing websites, I also have also been responsible for developing web 
        connected mobile applications (using both Phonegap and Titanium mobile), and systems that run on touchscreen kiosks 
        using web technologies.
